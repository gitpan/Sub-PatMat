Sub-PatMat version 0.01

Sub::PatMat - call a version of subroutine depending on its arguments

The Sub::PatMat module provides the programmer with the ability 
to define a subroutine multiple times and to specify what version
of the subroutine should be called, depending on the parameters
passed to it (or any other condition).

This is somewhat similar to argument pattern matching facility
provided by many programming languages.
